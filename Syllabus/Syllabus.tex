\textbf{Homework}
\end{center}
I think homework needs to be assigned between classes to ensure that the students are learning as much as possible. Just coming to class won't really help them learn everything, they need practice and individual assignments is the best way to give them that practice. I think the homework shouldn't be more than two hours a week (completely negotiable depending on outside input) but I haven't decided on whether to assign multiple short problems or a single slightly more involved problem.

\section*{Materials}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Projector (for all classes)
\item
A fully working + wired up drive train to test code on (Class 4+)
\item
Internet access (not absolutely necessary but would be nice)
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\section*{Logistics}
\end{center}
I think each class would be around 2.5 hours. The first 1.5 hours would be for teaching and the rest of the time would be for students to start working on the homework with us being there to help them if they have any problems.
