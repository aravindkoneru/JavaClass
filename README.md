#Java Lessons (FTC)

The main purpose of this repo is to introduce complete beginners to Java in
order to learn how to use the new FTC control system. If you are coming from
RobotC or have some experience in another programming language, it should be
relatively easy to learn how to use Java. However, if you are coming from no
experience at all, you may need more than just this repo to learn all the
necessary information. 

I made all of these resources by hand in order to teach FTC students the basics
of the new Android platform. I used these materials to teach the FTC team I
mentor about the new platform and was met with a decent amount of success.

#Java Lessons (FRC)

I will be updating this repo with examples and tutorials relevant to FRC programming once my college apps are done and I have more time. Expect to see updates starting in December.
